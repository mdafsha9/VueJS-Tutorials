      <h2><mark>What is VueJS ?</mark></h2>
      <p>VueJs is a progressive framework and it is used to build dynamic user interface and Single Page Applications. The core library is mainly focused on view-layer
      only. It is easily pick-up and intergrates with other libraries or existing projects.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>VueJS let we extend HTML with HTML attributes called directives</li>
        <li>VueJs directives offers functionality to HTML applications</li>
        <li>VueJs provides built-in directives and user defined directives</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><mark>Advantages of using VueJS</mark></h2>
      <h3>Small-in-size</h2>
      <p>The size of the framework is 18kb to 21kb and it takes no time for user download and use it.</p>
      <h3>Simple Integration</h3>
      <p>It is easily integrated with other libraries or existing projects</p>
      <h3>Flexibility</h3>
      <p>The flexibility also makes easy to understand for the developers of ReactJS, AngularJS and any other new JavaScript frameworks.</p>
      <h3>Easy to understand</h3>
      <p>One of the reason for the popularity of this framework is easy to understand. The user can easily add vuejs on his project because of the simple structure.  </p>
      <h3>Virtual DOM</h3>
      <p>It uses virtual DOM similar to the other existing projects like ReactJS, AngularJS etc. Virtual DOM is a light weight in-memory tree representation of the original HTML DOM and it updates without effecting original HTML DOM.</p>
      <h3>Components</h3>
      <p>It is used to create reusable custom elements in Vuejs application</p>
      <h3>Two-way data binding</h3>
      <p>VueJS facilities Two-way communication because of "MVVM" architecture which make's it quite easy to handle HTML blocks.</p>
      <h2><mark>Directives</mark></h2>
      <p>Directives are instructions for vuejs to do things in a certain way. Built-in directives are v-if, v-else, v-for, v-text, v-html, v-repeat, v-on, v-bind, v-attr, v-show, v-style, v-class etc.,
      <br/>Literal directives are v-transition, v-ref and v-el <br/>Empty Directives are v-pre and v-cloak</p>
      <h3>v-text directive:</h3>
      <p>Instead of interpolation, we can use v-text directive and it performs same job as interpolation<br/>
      or<br/>
      v-text directive updates an element textContent. Internally, {{mustache}} are also compiled as v-text directive on a textNode</p>
      <h3>v-once directive:</h3>
      <p>It is used to avoid unwanted re-renders of an element. It treats the element is a static content after rendering it once for the first time. It improves the performance as it does not have to be rendered again.</p>
      <h3>v-html directive</h3>
      <p>v-html directive updates the element's inner html. Using v-html, with users supplied data can be dangerous. It is suggested that you use v-html when you are absolutely sure about data source or pipe it through custom filters that sanitizes untrusted HTML.</p>
      <h3>v-bind directive:</h3>
      <p>It binds one or more attributes or a component props to an elements. if that attribute is bonded to our data defined  </p>
      <p>v-html directive updates the element's inner html. Using v-html, with users supplied data can be dangerous. It is suggested that you use v-html when you are absolutely sure about data source or pipe it through custom filters that sanitizes untrusted HTML.  </p>
      <h2>Form Input Bindings</h2>
      <h3>v-model directive:</h3>
      <p>It allows us to bind two-way data binding. We can bind Form input element for example makes it changes Vue data property when the user changes the content of the field. </p>
      <h2><mark>Conditional Rendering</mark></h2>
      <h3>v-if directive</h3>
      <p>The directive v-if is used conditionally rendered a block. The block will only be rendered if the directive's expression returns truthy value</p>
      <h2>Conditional groups with v-if on a <code>template eleement</code></h2>
      <p>Because v-if is a directive, it has to be attached to a single element. But what if we want to toggle with more than one element? In this case, we can use v-if on a <mark>template</mark> element which serves as a invisible wrapper. The final rendered result will not include <mark>template</mark> element. </p>
      <h3>v-else directive</h3>
      <p>We can use v-else directive to indicate 'else block' for "v-if" directive.<br/>
      v-else directive must immediately follow v-if or a v-else-if elements, otherwise it will not be recognized.</p>
      <h3>v-for directive</h3>
      <p>We can use v-for directive to render list of items based on an array. The v-for directive requires special syntax like "item in items". Where as items is a source data array and item is an alias array element is iterated on</p>
