    <h1><mark>Interview Questions</mark></h1>
    <h3>1. What is VueJs ?</h3>
    <p>VueJs is a progressive framework used to building dynamic user interface and Single Page Applications. The core library is mainly focused on view layer only and it is easy to pick-up and integrate with other libraries or existing applications.</p>
    <h3>Major feature's of VueJS</h3>
    <p><b>i. Virtual DOM :</b>It uses virtual DOM similar to other frameworks like ReactJs, Ember.js..Virtual DOM is a light weight in-memory tree representation of the original HTML DOM and it updated without affecting it's original DOM.<br/>
    <b>ii. Components :</b>It is used to create a reusable custom elements in VueJs applications.<br/>
    <b>iii. Routing :</b>Navigation between pages is acheived through Vue-router.<br/>
    <b>iv. Templates:</b>It provides HTML based templates that binds DOM with the Vue Instance data.<br/>
    <b>v. Light Weight:</b>VueJs is a light weight library compared to a other frameworks. </p>
    <h3>What is vue-resource?</h3>
    <p>Vue-resource is a plug-in for vuejs. This plug-in is used with vuejs, it makes web request or JSONP, in which XMLHttpRequest or JSONP. vue-resoucre has many features like Promise API or URL Templates.</p>
    <h3>Why we use webpack in vuejs?</h3>
    <p>Vuejs configures webpack, when we deploy our app, all our JavaScript files, CSS files or any dependencies get properly bundled together and optimized(minimized), resulting faster loading speed.</p>
    <h3>Hot Module Replacement(HMR)</h3>
    <p>In development mode, it enables Hot module Replacement, which means changes to our app will update live whenever we save our project.</p>
    <h3>Key attribute</h3>
    <p>Key attribute tells Vue, how your data relates to HTML elements it's rendering to the screen. When the data changes, Vue uses these keys to know which HTML elements to remove or update and if it needs to create any new once. </p>
    <h3>Data and methods</h3>
    <p>When Vue instance is created, add all the properties found in its data object to Vue's reactivity system. When the values of those properties change, the view will "react", updating to match the new values.</p>
    <h3>Difference between the data property in Vue instance and Vue components?</h3>
    <p>All Vue components are also Vue instance, so accept the same option objects (except for a few root-specific options) The root Vue Instance accepts properties like el and router, but Vue component cannot. The data property of root Vue Instance is an object, but the Vue component must be a function.</p>
    <h3>Instance Lifecycle hooks</h3>
    <p>Each Vue Instance goes through a series of initialization steps. For example--it needs to set up data observation, compile the template, mount the instance to the DOM, update the DOM when the data changes. Along the way, it also runs functions called Lifecycle hooks, giving users the opportunity to add their own code at specific stages.</p>
    <h3>Template syntax</h3>
    <p>It provide HTML based templates that binds DOM with the Vue Instance data. All Vuejs templates are valid HTML that can be parsed by specific compliant browser and HTML parser.<br/>
    Under the hood, Vue compiles the template into Virtual DOM render functions. Combined with the reactivity system, Vue is able to intelligently figure out the minimal number of components re-render and apply the minimal amount of DOM manipulations when the app state changes. </p>
    <h3>Difference between computed properties and methods</h3>
    <p>Instead of computed propeerties we can define the same function as a method. For the end result, the two approaches are indeed exactly same. However the difference in computed properties are cached based on their reactive dependencies.<br/>
     methods don't know if the values used in the function changed so the need to run everytime to check. Computed properties know if the the values used in the function change so they don't need to run everytime to check, only once.</p>
